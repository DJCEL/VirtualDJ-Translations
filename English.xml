    </multibutton_select>
    <mute>Mute a specific deck</mute>
    <mute_stem>mute one stem. Stem names are: "HiHat", "Vocal", "Instru", "Bass", "Kick", or you can use aggregate stems: "Melody" (Instru+Bass), "Rhythm" (HiHat+Kick), "MeloRhythm" (Instru+Bass+HiHat+Kick)</mute_stem>

    <only_stem>keep only one stem. Stem names are: "HiHat", "Vocal", "Instru", "Bass", "Kick", or you can use aggregate stems: "Melody" (Instru+Bass), "Rhythm" (HiHat+Kick), "MeloRhythm" (Instru+Bass+HiHat+Kick)</only_stem>
    <open_help>open the user guide</open_help>
    <os2l_button>
      Send a command to a DMX software over OS2L: 'os2l_button "blackout"', 'os2l_button "fog machine" while_pressed', etc.
      If you want to specify a page, you can use 'os2l_button "mypage" "mybutton"'.
      If the DMX software doesn't send feedback commands, os2l_button acts as a flash button (it sends 'on' when pressed, 'off' when released) - use 'os2l_button "mybutton" on' to not send commands on release.
      If the DMX software sends feedback commands, os2l_button acts as a toggle button (it sends the opposite of the last feedback when pressed, nothing on release) - use 'os2l_button "mybutton" while_pressed' to send a command on release.
    </os2l_button>
    <os2l_cmd>Send a numeric command to a DMX software over OS2L: 'os2l_cmd 42 on' or 'os2l_cmd 43 50%'</os2l_cmd>
    <os2l_scene>
      similar to os2l_button, but sends 'on' to the DMX software only if the button was not active yet, and only if the deck is audible. (requires feedback from the DMX software)
      when the deck is not audible, the scene will be queued and started when the deck becomes audible
      os2l_scene "scene1"

      param_cast 'int_trunc' : provides the integer part of a number without rounding to the nearest integer
      param_cast 'frac' : provides the decimal part of a number.

    <pitch>
      Set the pitch of the deck. Without parameters it can be assigned to sliders
      Used with a number, it gives the position on the slider (and therefore account for pitch_range). ('pitch 0.25' set pitch at -10% if pitch range is 20%)
      Used with a percent it gives an absolute position.  'pitch 112%' set pitch at +12%
      Relative values are possible too. 'pitch +0.1%', 'pitch +0.1 bpm'
      When used with 'bpm', the pitch is set to match the bpm. 'pitch 130 bpm' set pitch to match 130 bpm
    </pitch>
    <pitch_bend>slow down or speed up the song: 'pitch_bend +3%'. you can make the bend to increase slowly by specifying a second time parameter: 'pitch_bend +1% 500ms' will start at +1% and will double every 500ms.</pitch_bend>

      'pitch_range +1' scrolls through the default pitch ranges. 'pitch_range "12,16,25" +1' scrolls through the provided list of pitch ranges.
      'pitch_range +1 deck' changes the pitch range only for the specific deck
    </pitch_range>
    <pitch_relative>set the pitch of the deck, to be used by hardware controllers if you prefer the change to be relative to the software pitch position</pitch_relative>
    <pitch_reset>
      Slowly brings the pitch back to 0%. You can specify the speed in % per second (default uses the pitchResetSpeed option): 'pitch_reset 5%'
      You can also specify the speed in ms or beats: 'pitch_reset 500ms' or 'pitch_reset 4bt'
    </pitch_reset>
    <pitch_zero>
      Set pitch to 0% (normal playing speed)
      Use 'pitch_zero "center"' on controllers that send a message when the pitch slider is at the center. This prevents unwanted behavior in gradual or relative mode.
    </pitch_zero>
    <pitchlock>when Pitch Lock is on, moving the pitch slider on one deck will move the slider on the other deck to keep the sync</pitchlock>

If you are playing a lot of MP3 files, we recommend using a 44100 samplerate. If you are playing a lot of VOB videos, we recommend using 48000. As a rule, a bigger samplerate DOES NOT mean a better sound quality, on the opposite. The best quality is when your source file, internal samplerate, and soundcard, all use the same value. And since you can change the value of the soundcard and of VirtualDJ, but not of the source files, you should set the value that matches most of your files (mp3 are 44100, videos are 48000)</sampleRate>
